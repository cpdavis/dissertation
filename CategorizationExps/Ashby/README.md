# Ashby-Style Perceptual Learning Task

In this task, participants learn to categorize Gabor patches. This folder contains scripts for generating patch parameters in R and for running the experiment using PsychoPy.

### Important notes:
* Displaying Gabor patches in Psychopy requires that you use the Monitor Center to input relevant parameters (e.g., distance from screen, resolution, etc.). This is so that Psychopy can calculate visual degrees.
