\section{General Introduction}

	Categories help us organize the world. They help us predict and hypothesize about category members, helping us quickly select the most appropriate response for each situation. We also rely on language during these processes. As \citet{Lupyan2012} puts it, language augments our thought. For categories, language provides structure in the form of category labels, but language also affects how we think about and even perceive the categories themselves. Thus any thorough investigation of how we learn categories must consider the role of language. \par
	Indeed, many theoretical frameworks of category learning involve language -- some even reference it right in the name. For example, a key theory in perceptual category learning, COVIS, stands for "competition between verbal and implicit systems'" \citep{Ashby1998}. Similarly, a theory put forth by Minda and colleagues is called "A theory of verbal and nonverbal category learning" \citep{Minda2010}. However, to date most theories of category learning that consider language primarily determine whether language has an influence on systems for category learning, rather than further defining the role language plays in these systems.\par
	Thus, the current work seeks to both define a theory of category learning and explore the role language has in this theory. In this review I will synthesize multiple approaches to category learning, all of which have some type of dual-systems model. Following the synthesis, I will review relevant literature that provides suggestions as to how language might be involved in category learning in a dual-systems model. Through these efforts, I will provide a theoretical framework and hypotheses for this dissertation.

\subsection{Dual-systems model for category learning}
	Multiple theories converge on the idea that there are two systems for category learning. In this section, I will first describe a generalized dual-systems model that pulls threads from all of these theories and then go on to describe how each theory fits into the overarching framework. 
	
\subsubsection{Proposed model}
	The proposed model involves two systems for category learning. The first, which I title the \textbf{associative system}, uses associative mechanisms in an iterative manner to learn distributions of features. This system is best suited for learning multidimensional \textit{similarity-based} categories such as natural kinds, where it is difficult to describe necessary and sufficient rules for inclusion. Similarity-based categories have features that are correlated and probabilistic, such that a category instance may not have all of the category-relevant features but tends to have some distribution of them. For example, Manx cats do not have tails, a typical feature of cats, but are still undeniably members of the category \textit{cat}. Thus, the associative system must be able to extract the most frequent pattern of features over many instances in order to learn a category. \par
	The second one is called the \textbf{hypothesis-testing system}. This system uses a more explicit learning method to test and adjust hypotheses about category boundaries. This method relies on selection of relevant features rather than representation of a distribution of feature probabilities. As such, it is most suited for learning rule-based categories, which typically have one or a few easily verbalizable rules for inclusion. For example, the \textit{ad hoc} category \textit{things to be sold at the garage sale} has a simple rule for inclusion that perfectly separates members from non-members. \par
	Thus, we have two systems for category learning, each one ideal for learning a different type of category (similarity-based vs. rule-based). In the upcoming sections, I will describe theoretical and empirical evidence for a dual-systems model from five different approaches to category learning. I will show how each approach informs the current theoretical framework.
\subsubsection{COVIS}
COVIS stands for COmpetition between Verbal and Implicit Systems and is a prominent theoretical framework for perceptual category learning first proposed by \citeauthor{Ashby1998} in 1998. This framework provides a dual-systems model that is grounded in neuropsychological data, allowing it to suggest neurobiological underpinnings for the two systems. It is important to note from the beginning that this framework is mostly concerned with perceptual categories, which are defined as "a collection of similar objects belonging to the same group" \citep[~p. 151]{Ashby2005}. This is in contrast to concepts, which they define as groups of related ideas. Thus, this approach focuses on categorizing objects that can be encountered and perceived in the real world. \par
	As can be inferred from the title, the two category learning systems in COVIS are the \textbf{verbal} and \textbf{implicit} systems. The verbal system is COVIS' answer to our hypothesis-testing system. It is a declarative learning system that uses a hypothesis-testing method to learn category rules, typically for rule-based stimuli. Under COVIS, rule-based stimuli must have inclusion rules that are easy to describe verbally. Typically, rule-based stimuli used by Ashby and colleagues have a single rule for inclusion or two rules combined by "and" or "or."  When a rule-based category involves multiple dimensions, decisions about each dimension are made separately, and these decisions are used to evaluate the logical operators. In other words, each dimension is considered on its own before their combination. These guidelines for rule-based categories ensure that an explicit, verbalizable hypothesis-testing method can be used to learn them. When learning a new category, the verbal system holds candidates for category inclusion rules in working memory, which are tested as stimuli are encountered. Over time, the hypotheses are tested and switched until they reflect the optimal strategy for categorization. \par
	The implicit system from COVIS is most similar to our associative system. Like the associative system, it uses incremental learning to find category boundaries. It is most ideal for learning information-integration categories, which are like similarity-based categories but have also some specific guidelines. Information-integration categories are defined by some combination of dimensions, like some rule-based categories. However, while each dimension can be considered separately in rule-based categories, all dimensions must be considered simultaneously for information-integration categories. Information-integration category membership depends on both the values associated with each dimension as well as the relationship between these values. Information-integration category boundaries are difficult or impossible to describe verbally. COVIS suggests that the implicit system relies on an information stream that connects stimuli, motor responses, and feedback to learn category membership.
