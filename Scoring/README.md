# Scoring Instructions

Both experiments have multiple individual difference measures that must be scored. Here you will find information about how to score them.

## Experiment 1

### Data Access

Scoring for this experiment requires access to three sets of data.

1. The BehavioralScores_Exp1 google sheet. This is where you will record the scores. To gain access, email kayleigh.ryherd@uconn.edu. Once you have access to this file, you will find it in your Google Drive.
2. The audio recordings for WA, CELF, and TOWRE. These will be stored in a TBA place.
3. The response form binders for WA, CELF, TOWRE, and Raven's. These can be found at Kayleigh's desk.

Each assessment must be scored twice. You can be scorer 1 or scorer 2 for any assessment, but not both. So, if you were the first person to score an assessment, you may not re-score it and be scorer 2.

### CELF

CELF stands for Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals, which measures language ability broadly. We use a single subtest from this measure -- Recalling Sentences. In this task, participants hear a sentence and repeat the sentence.

The guidelines for scoring the CELF are a little confusing, so make sure to review them. They can be found in the CELF Response Forms binder.

**Materials needed**: 

* CELF Response Forms binder
* Computer
* Headphones

1. Open the scoring spreadsheet to the CELF. For each subject that still needs to be scored, do the following.
2.	Listen to each sound file and score each item. Details about scoring can be found in the "Scoring Guidelines" tab of the binder. Feel free to mark up the response form.4.	Add the points from each item together. Record this number under “Raw Score.”5. Obtain the scaling table from the "Scoring Guidelines" tab of the binder.
6. Under the "Recalling Sentences" column, find the participant's raw score. Find the corresponding scaled score. Record that number under "Standard Score."7.	Add your initials and the date you scored this participant.

**Note:** It might be easier to do a bunch of raw scores first and then standardize them, rather than doing raw and standard scores for each participant.

### Raven's

Raven's Advanced Matrices are a test of nonverbal IQ. Because we used restricted timing for this assessment, we will only be obtaining raw scores.
**Materials needed**: 

* Raven's Response Forms binder

1. Open the scoring spreadsheet to the Raven's. For each subject that still needs to be scored, do the following.
2. Obtain the answer keys from the front of the response forms binder. The answers are along the edges of the page to make it easy to line up to the response form.
3. Using the answer key, count the number of correct answers for each subject. Feel free to mark up the response form.
4. Copy that number to "Score."
5. 	Add your initials and the date you scored this participant.

### TOWRE

TOWRE stands for Test of Word Reading Efficiency. It is a measure of reading fluency. We are only using the Phonemic Decoding Efficiency (PDE) subtest.

This test uses nonwords as stimuli. There is a guide in the from of the response forms binder with IPA transcriptions of all acceptable ways to say the words. Take a look at [this website](http://www.yorku.ca/earmstro/ipa/index.html) if you are not familiar with IPA -- it will help you decode the symbols.

**Materials needed**: 

* TOWRE Response Forms binder
* Computer
* Headphones

1. Open the scoring spreadsheet to the TOWRE. For each subject that still needs to be scored, do the following.
2.	Listen to each sound file and count how many correct responses the participant was able to make in 45 seconds. The experimenter should cut the participant off after 45 seconds, **but if they do not, only count the words said in the first 45 seconds**. Feel free to mark up the response forms.4.	Record this number under “Raw Score.”5. Obtain the standardization table from the "Scoring Guidelines" tab of the binder.
6.	Make sure you are looking at the PDE standardization table.
7. Find the participant's raw score under "Raw Score" and use it to find the corresponding standard score. Copy this number to "Standard Score."7.	Add your initials and the date you scored this participant.**Note:** It might be easier to do a bunch of raw scores first and then standardize them, rather than doing raw and standard scores for each participant.


### WA

WA stands for Word Attack, which is the nonword decoding subtest of the Woodcock-Johnson III. 

This test uses nonwords as stimuli. There is a guide in the front of the binder that I created which has information about how to say the words, including common pronunciations that are not correct.

**Materials needed**: 

* WA Response Forms binder
* Computer
* Headphones

1. Open the scoring spreadsheet to the WA. For each subject that still needs to be scored, do the following.
2.	Listen to each sound file and count the number of correct responses. Feel free to mark up the response forms.4.	Record this number under “Raw Score.”5.	Add your initials and the date you scored this participant.

Standardizing WA requires special software. This software is available on the public computers and we can probably get a copy installed onto whatever computer you tend to work at. The software is called WJ-III NU (Woodcock-Johnson III Normative Update).

1. Open the software.
2. Select "create a new database."
3. Save it somewhere you will be able to access later.
4. Click the New button on the right (not the page).
5. Put the subject's number in the ID field.
6. Put a dummy code (x) for First Name.
7. Enter a dummy birthdate based on the participant's age.  
	18: 3/3/2000  
	19: 3/3/1999  
	20: 3/3/1998  
	21: 3/3/1997  
8. Enter a dummy gender (M or F, doesn't really matter).
9. Click Save.
10. Click Add Test Record and select Tests of Achievement, Form A.
11. Enter the date of testing (found on the spreadsheet).
12. Enter the raw score into box 13.
13. Click the floppy disk (save).
14. Click the back arrow.
15. Select the new test record. Go to the Reports menu and click Score Report...
16. Click the >| arrow to jump to the end of the score report creation.
17. Click Preview.
18. You will see the standard score under SS. Ignore the 68% band part of that column. Copy that number to the "Standard Score" column in the spreadsheet. 
19. Click "Return to Subject Information" to do the next subject.

**Note:** It *might* be easier to do a bunch of raw scores first and then standardize them, rather than doing raw and standard scores for each participant, but it might not. Feel free to try both approaches.
