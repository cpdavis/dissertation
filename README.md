# Kayleigh's Dissertation Github Repository

Welcome to the repository for my dissertation. Here is where I will keep documentation, stimuli, and scripts for the experiments in my dissertation. Hopefully, this means I'll remember what I did when it comes time to write the thing.

## Experiments

### Experiment 1: Interaction between systems across language ability
**Aim:** To understand how using and switching between the associative and hypothesis testing systems varies across language ability. Basically, I am trying to figure out if there are any order effects to doing the Sloutsky task within-subject, and if these order effects change with individual differences in language ability.

#### Methods

**Category learning task:** The main design for this experiment comes from [Kloos and Sloutsky (2008)](http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0096-3445.137.1.52). See the documentation for this task [here](./CategorizationExps/Sloutsky/README.md).

**Individual difference measures:** I am using multiple measures of individual differences, loosely based on the [epiSLI criteria](http://jslhr.pubs.asha.org/article.aspx?articleid=1781254). These include:

* TOWRE (comprehension)
* KTEA (narrative, comprehension)
* Nelson-Denny vocabulary (vocabulary)
* CELF recalling sentences (grammar, expression)

### Experiment 2: Comparability of category learning approaches

**Aim:** To directly compare different approaches to a dual-systems model of category learning.

#### Methods

**Category learning experiments:**

* Sloutsky statistical density task (see above)
* Ashby perceptual category learning task (based on [Maddox et al., 2003](http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2003-06626-016)).
* Taxonomic/thematic classification task (based on [Markman & Hutchison, 1984](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0010028584900021)).

### Experiment 3: Individual differences in vocabulary and executive function

**Aim:** Determine whether and how language is differentially related to the associative and hypothesis testing systems. I expect that vocabulary ability will be related to use of the associative system, and that executive function ability will be related to use of the hypothesis-testing system.

#### Methods

**Category learning task(s):** Based on the results of Experiment 2, I will use either only the Sloutsky task or all three of the above tasks.

**Individual difference measures:**

* Nelson-Denny vocabulary
* CELF formulating sentences and recalling sentences
* Tower of London (planning)
* Switcher (cognitive flexibility)
* Go/no-go (inhibition)

The last three tasks (executive function) are built and presented using the [Psychology Experiment Building Language](http://pebl.sourceforge.net/) (PEBL). They are included in the main download of PEBL. The only change we made was to the Switcher task; instead of seeing whole words, participants see single letters (e.g., Color --> C).
