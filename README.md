# Kayleigh's Dissertation Github Repository

Welcome to the repository for my dissertation. Here is where I will keep documentation, stimuli, and scripts for the experiments in my dissertation. Hopefully, this means I'll remember what I did when it comes time to write the thing.

## Experiments

### Experiment 1: Category Learning (fMRI)
The main design for this experiment comes from [Kloos and Sloutsky (2008)](http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0096-3445.137.1.52). This study aims to look for the neural basis of the compression- and selection-based systems for category learning in adolescents with a range of reading comprehension ability as well as intact decoding and general cognitive function.

See the documentation for this task [here](./CatLearningfMRI/catlearning.md).
